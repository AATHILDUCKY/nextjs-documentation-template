# Troubleshooting Login Failures in Welford IAG

When a user reports that they **cannot log in**, walk through this checklist
before escalating.

## 1. Confirm the error pattern

Ask the user for:

- Exact error message (or screenshot)
- Approximate time of the last failed attempt
- Whether this affects **only them** or **multiple users**

From the UI, note whether the failure happens:

- Before the identity provider redirect (local auth), or
- After returning from SSO (Azure AD, Okta, etc.).

## 2. Check basic account status

1. Open the **IAG admin portal**.
2. Navigate to the **Users** section.
3. Search using **email address** or **employee ID**.
4. Verify that:
   - The account is *active*.
   - The assigned roles are correct.
   - The account is not locked or disabled.

If the account is missing:

- Confirm that the **HR/source system sync job** has run successfully.
- Trigger a manual sync where allowed, then re-check.

## 3. Validate SSO configuration

For SSO flows (Azure AD / IdP):

- Confirm the **application registration** is not disabled.
- Check that the **redirect URL** matches the URL configured in IAG.
- Validate that the **certificate or client secret** is not expired.
- Confirm the user is assigned to the correct **enterprise app** in the IdP.

If the error is `invalid audience` or `invalid issuer`, re-check the **metadata
URL** and application ID configuration.

## 4. Inspect logs

Use the platform monitoring (e.g., Azure Application Insights, centralized logs)
to filter by:

- user ID or email,
- correlation ID (if shown in the error),
- time range (±5 minutes around the reported time).

Look for:

- Token validation errors
- Expired tokens
- Clock skew issues between services
- Network or timeout errors contacting the IdP

## 5. Apply common fixes

- Resync the user from the source directory.
- Re-grant application access in the IdP.
- Renew or update any expired SSO certificates.
- Clear cached tokens/session cookies and attempt again.

Document the **root cause** and **final fix** in this writeup so it can be
reused by the next person facing the same issue.
