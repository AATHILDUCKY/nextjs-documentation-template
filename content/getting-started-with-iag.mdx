# Welcome to the Welford IAG Support Portal

This portal is designed for **implementers, support engineers, and customers** who
need fast, searchable access to troubleshooting steps and configuration guides.

## How the knowledge base is organized

- **Onboarding** – high-level guides that explain how modules fit together.
- **How-to writeups** – short, focused articles that solve one specific task.
- **Troubleshooting** – root-cause analysis style steps for known issues.
- **Operational runbooks** – repeatable procedures for common support flows.

Each article is stored as Markdown/MDX, versioned in your repository, and
automatically indexed by this frontend for instant search.

## Best practices for new writeups

When you add a new writeup:

1. **Use a clear, action-style title**  
   For example: `Fixing login failures caused by expired SSO certificates`

2. **Add the right tags**  
   Include module, feature, and environment (e.g. `provisioning`, `azure-ad`,
   `prod`, `tenant-sync`).

3. **Capture the root cause and final fix**  
   Support engineers should be able to follow your steps exactly and reach
   the same resolution.

## Next steps

Use the search bar above and try a few common keywords:

- `provisioning delay`
- `account not visible in IAG`
- `role sync mismatch`

You should immediately see suggested writeups that match your query.
