# Investigating Provisioning Delays

If a user has been **created or updated in the source system** (HR, AD, etc.)
but the changes are not visible in Welford IAG, use this runbook.

## 1. Confirm expectations

Verify with the requester:

- Which **system of record** was updated (HR, AD, CSV import, etc.).
- When the change was made.
- What they expected to see in IAG (new account, new role, deprovisioning).

## 2. Check the provisioning schedule

Go to the **Job / Scheduler monitoring** dashboard and confirm:

- The last successful run time and duration.
- Any failed runs in the last 24 hours.
- Queued or stuck jobs.

If jobs are failing, capture:

- Error message
- Stack trace
- Affected connector (e.g. `HR -> IAG`, `IAG -> AD`).

## 3. Inspect connector configuration

For the relevant connector, review:

- Connection / credential validity.
- Filter configuration (OUs, attributes, group filters).
- Recent configuration changes (test vs prod endpoints, throttling).

## 4. Sample a specific user

Attempt to pull a single sample user from the source:

- Run a **test query** in the connector configuration.
- Confirm the user appears in the raw result.
- Validate key attributes (unique ID, email, status flags).

If the user doesn&apos;t appear here, the issue is **upstream** of IAG.

## 5. Re-run and re-check

If safe, trigger a **manual sync** for the affected connector and monitor:

- Queue depth and progress.
- Errors for that specific user ID.

Once the account appears in IAG, verify:

- Correct roles and entitlements
- Correct lifecycle state (active, leaver, etc.)

## 6. Document the incident

Add a short note to your internal incident/problem tracker with:

- Root cause
- Resolution steps
- Any tuning applied (e.g. schedule, batch size, retry policy)

This helps future provisioning incidents get resolved much faster.
